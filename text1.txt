First, make sure you're on the branch you want to merge from (let's call it your third branch)

git checkout third-branch
Merge the third branch into the second branch

git checkout second-branch git merge third-branch
Create a fourth branch

git checkout -b fourth-branch
Then merge the fourth branch into the third branch

git checkout third-branch git merge fourth-branch
If you want to push these changes to GitHub, you'll need to push each branch:

git push origin second-branch git push origin third-branch git push origin fourth-branch
